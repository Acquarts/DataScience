This project is a functional prototype of an academic risk prediction tool built with Streamlit. It allows users to simulate student profiles and receive instant predictions based on academic, economic, and demographic variables.
The model was developed in Python using scikit-learn and integrated into a bilingual web interface for demonstration and testing purposes.
