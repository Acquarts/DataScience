# ðŸŒ¿ About Dataset

This dataset simulates real-world smart farming operations powered by IoT sensors and satellite data. It captures environmental and operational variables that affect crop yield across **500 farms** located in regions like **India, the USA, and Africa**.

Designed to reflect modern **agritech systems**, the data is ideal for:

- Predictive modeling using ML/AI  
- Time-series analysis  
- Sensor-based optimization  
- Environmental data visualizations  
- Crop health analytics  

---

## ðŸ§  Ideal For

- Supervised ML models (regression, classification)  
- Yield prediction and optimization  
- Agricultural decision support systems  
- Smart irrigation strategy analysis  
- Data visualization of regional farm efficiency
