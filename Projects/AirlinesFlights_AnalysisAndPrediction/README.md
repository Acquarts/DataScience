# Airlines Flights Dataset for Different Cities

The **Flights Booking Dataset** of various airlines is scraped date-wise from a well-known website in a structured format. The dataset contains records of flight travel details between cities in India, including features such as **Source & Destination City**, **Arrival & Departure Time**, **Duration**, and **Price**.

This data is available as a **CSV file** and is analyzed using the **Pandas DataFrame**.

This analysis is helpful for professionals working in the **Airlines** and **Travel** domains.

Using this dataset, we answered multiple questions with Python in our project.

## Questions Addressed

- **Q.1.** What are the airlines in the dataset, accompanied by their frequencies?
- **Q.2.** Show bar graphs representing the Departure Time & Arrival Time.
- **Q.3.** Show bar graphs representing the Source City & Destination City.
- **Q.4.** Does price vary with airlines?
- **Q.5.** Does ticket price change based on the departure time and arrival time?
- **Q.6.** How does the price change with different Source and Destination cities?
- **Q.7.** How is the price affected when tickets are bought just 1 or 2 days before departure?
- **Q.8.** How does the ticket price vary between Economy and Business class?
- **Q.9.** What will be the average price of Vistara airline for a flight from Delhi to Hyderabad in Business Class?

## Main Features / Columns

1. **Airline**  
   The name of the airline company.  
   _Type:_ Categorical (6 different airlines)

2. **Flight**  
   The plane's flight code.  
   _Type:_ Categorical

3. **Source City**  
   City from which the flight takes off.  
   _Type:_ Categorical (6 unique cities)

4. **Departure Time**  
   Derived categorical feature created by binning time periods.  
   _Type:_ Categorical (6 time labels)

5. **Stops**  
   Number of stops between source and destination cities.  
   _Type:_ Categorical (3 distinct values)

6. **Arrival Time**  
   Derived categorical feature created by binning time intervals.  
   _Type:_ Categorical (6 time labels)

7. **Destination City**  
   City where the flight will land.  
   _Type:_ Categorical (6 unique cities)

8. **Class**  
   Seat class of the ticket.  
   _Type:_ Categorical (Business, Economy)

9. **Duration**  
   Total travel time between cities in hours.  
   _Type:_ Continuous

10. **Days Left**  
    Days between the booking date and the trip date.  
    _Type:_ Derived numerical feature

11. **Price**  
    Ticket price.  
    _Type:_ Target variable




# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Price Prediction - Insights

## 1. Distribution and Trends
- The dataset shows a wide variability in prices, with extreme cases on both ends (very cheap and very expensive flights).  
- The **class** variable has a clear impact: **Business** flights have significantly higher prices than **Economy**.  
- **days_left** (days remaining until the flight) follows the expected trend: the fewer the days left, the higher the price, with sharp increases in the last days before departure.  
- Flight **duration** shows an inverse relationship with price for short and direct routes, but for longer routes the relationship is not always linear, likely due to combinations of stops and cities.

## 2. Model Results

### RandomForest
- **RMSE:** ‚âà 2,720  
- **MAE:** ‚âà 1,065  
- **R¬≤:** ‚âà 0.9856  
- Strong overall performance, low errors, and high explanatory power, though it tends to make bigger mistakes for high-priced flights.

### XGBoost
- **RMSE:** ‚âà 2,454  
- **MAE:** ‚âà 1,258  
- **R¬≤:** ‚âà 0.9883  
- Slight improvement in RMSE and R¬≤ compared to RF, with a small increase in MAE.  
- Cross-validation confirms model stability and generalization.

## 3. Feature Importance
Top influential variables for both models:
1. `class`  
2. `days_left`  
3. `duration`  
4. `stops`  
5. Time-related features (`departure_time_sin`, `arrival_time_cos`)  
6. Origin/destination cities (moderate importance)  

- Airline-related features have lower but still relevant impact.

---

## 4. Explainability (SHAP Analysis)
- Not being Business class strongly reduces the predicted price.  
- Booking with very few days left significantly increases the price.  
- Shorter flight duration tends to lower the price.  
- Airline and departure time effects are secondary but still present.  
- Both models tend to have higher prediction errors for expensive flights, suggesting that extreme values in the dataset are harder to model.

---

## 5. Conclusions and Opportunities
- Both models are robust, but **XGBoost** provides a slight edge in overall accuracy.  
- Performance for high-priced flights could be improved by:
  - Balancing the dataset in those price ranges.  
  - Using hybrid models or transforming the target variable (e.g., `log(price)`).  
- SHAP interpretability adds value in understanding the drivers of price and could be leveraged for:
  - Dynamic pricing systems.  
  - User recommendations.
